### 👋 Hello there! I'm Islam, a full stack web developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, honed through an intensive course at Orange Coding Academy. Currently in my fourth year of Computer Information Systems at Hashemite University, I'm passionate about web development and eager to share my journey on GitHub.

🎓 My academic journey and hands-on project experience have equipped me with a deep understanding of software development. From conceptualization to crafting intuitive user experiences, I enjoy the entire lifecycle of a project, ensuring both functionality and a seamless user interface.

🌟 My expertise spans across modern front-end technologies like React, where I excel at building interactive, responsive, and accessible user interfaces. With a focus on state management techniques like Redux and Context API, I aim to create fluid user experiences. I’m also proficient in breaking down complex UIs into reusable components for efficient and scalable design.

🛠️ On the back end, I have strong proficiency in building secure and scalable server-side systems. I've developed RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js, integrated authentication systems using JWT and OAuth, and built real-time communication features using WebSockets. I'm also experienced in handling payments with PayPal and Stripe, and managing databases with PostgreSQL.

🚀 My project portfolio includes impactful platforms such as a movie streaming service, an e-event management system, and a regional election management platform. These projects feature live broadcasting, chat systems, AI-based question answering, and reservation functionalities, all while focusing on security, performance optimization, and scalability.
